                                 Udawalawe was primarily established to protect the wide variety of flora and fauna present in the park and to serve as a sanctuary for the numerous wild elephants that called the area home.
                                 It also serves as a catchment area for the Udawalawe Reservoir, a vital source of water for the surrounding area.<br>
                                 Nestled in the district of Uva, part of the Udawalawe reservoir, the largest water body in Sri Lanka's dry zone, the park is renowned for its spectacular wildlife (read: elephants, and many of them!) and breathtaking vistas.
                                 It encompasses an area of around 31,000 hectares.</p>

This gentle giant has gained worldwide recognition as a beloved wildlife icon due to its gentle nature and unwavering size.
                                With 600 wild elephants in the park right now, according to recent estimates, it is home to one of Sri Lanka's largest and most stable elephant populations.<br>
                                Udawalawe National Park offers you the chance to see a variety of mammals in addition to large herds of elephants, including deers, sloth bears, leopards, monkeys, water buffaloes, crocodiles, and jackals.<br>
                                Udawalawe boasts a wide diversity. There are 135 different species of butterflies, 184 birds, 33 reptiles, and 43 mammals. In addition to elephants and leopards, other animals that may be seen include water buffaloes, wild boars, crocodiles, peacocks, and spotted deer.</p>

                              <p class="bordered-paragraph">One of the last primary tropical rainforests in the island nation is the Sinharaja Rainforest, which is situated in the southwest of Sri Lanka and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sinharaja, which means "Lion Kingdom" in Sinhala and suggests regal ties, has a long history that spans centuries. Because of the forest's importance to the local economy and biodiversity, the local people have always valued and guarded it. <br>
                                The Sri Lankan government designated Sinharaja as a Biosphere Reserve in 1978 after realizing its exceptional ecological value. Later that year, in 1988, it was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage List. With an area of over 8,864 hectares, this rainforest is home to a wide range of plants and fauna, many of which are indigenous. Its preservation is essential for both the global significance of tropical rainforests in preserving ecological balance and biodiversity, as well as for the preservation of Sri Lanka's natural heritage. Sinharaja is still an important location for environmental education, ecotourism, and scientific study today.</p>

                              <p class="bordered-paragraph"> Sinharaja is a unique place to go birdwatching because it is estimated that 95% of Sri Lanka's endemic species may be found there. The presence of mixed species foraging bird flocks, a regular sight in rainforests, is another fascinating sight to be found in Sinharaja.  Research has shown that out of the hundred such flocks that have been methodically examined, some of them had 48 species, 12 of which are peculiar to the island.<br>
                                  The White-headed Starling, Ashy-headed Babbler, Sri Lanka Blue Magpie, and Red-faced Malkoha are among the uncommon endemic birds that can be spotted in the Sinharaja Rain Forest. It has been determined that the Green-billed Coucal is the Rarest bird in Sri Lanka.<br>
                                  Several deer species, including the elusive sambar deer and the spotted deer, can be found on the island. Marsh crocodiles and water monitors can frequently be seen in the wetlands and rivers, while a variety of marine species, including sea turtles and dolphins, can be seen along the coastal areas. Leopards live in the rainforests of Sri Lanka, which makes it one of the few places on earth where these large animals may be seen in the wild.<br>
                                  The colorful tapestry of Sri Lanka's non-avian wildlife also includes sloth bears, wild boars, and several kinds of primates, such as macaques and langurs. The nation's dedication to maintaining its rare and valuable biodiversity is demonstrated by the conservation initiatives and national parks set up to safeguard these species.</p>
